he0001,okay this makes a lot more sense sorry for the confusion my understanding was based on a 2x issue where their vnode data was not flat which would mean all information even if extracted would be transferred as attributes if you did not empty dataattrs object as this information exists on both props and attrs now that it is flat properties won't be transferred when extracting which will mitigate this issue,M09,MISTAKE

he0004,hello i must apologize all our my and my team's problems were related to the keystore thank you very much @samtstern without you we would have continued to try without success one of our colleagues changed the sha1 code on firebase for some personal trials without warning us and then we started to have problems even though i cannot understand why on one smartphone it worked even with the wrong key now after updating all key related settings sha1 on firebase google-servicesjson in the app the login works with all the devices thank you again and sorry,M09,MISTAKE
he0005,wait sorry missed that the yarn audit command already exists with your pr so basically the only change i'd suggest would be to run it by default on yarn add and filter out the existing errors but that's your call i'd also maybe suggest to make --audit on install prompt the user at install-time when they would install a vulnerable packages before they're actually installed,S06,SLIP

he0016,this is incorrect behaviour i'm afraid the charset parameter is only defined for documents of type text* that does not apply to applicationx-www-form-urlencoded therefore sending charset would be a specification violation our behaviour is consistent with the w3c html5 specification which says the following if the form element has an accept-charset attribute let the selected character encoding be the result of picking an encoding for the form otherwise if the form element has no accept-charset attribute but the document's character encoding is an ascii-compatible character encoding then that is the selected character encoding otherwise let the selected character encoding be utf-8 we can't do either of the first two things because we don't know what the document or form looks like so we can only do the third if the user wants a different behaviour per the first two points they are required to do it themselves i'm sorry we can't accept this but this is one of those things that seems like it should be simple but is actually quite complex,S03,SLIP

he0081,well fair point i'd reported issues just like this myself the bitter truth is you have to rely on your system package manager and just keep usrlocal empty the best make uninstall is rm -rf usrlocal* the more permanent stuff you keep alive under usrlocal the more pita you'll have with it in the long run however usrlocal shines in playground-style experiments worse you can't trust package authors to do uninstall properly that is another reason why package managers exist so that we have this epic bug occur exactly once and learn from the lesson in that bug an author rolled his own uninstall script and made a fatal typo rm -rf usr libnvidia-currentxorgxorg -- spot the extra space sure we'll fix this in guake but many more other projects won't many projects don't even offer make uninstall -- correctly delegating that function to package managers i'm sorry that you had to have the adventure to figure this out but the advice is just don't make the habit to rely on it,M03,MISTAKE

he0180,hi matthew thanks for reaching out – sorry this took a few days to bubble up to the top after the long weekend we use the data that vs code gathers to provide and improve the product for example in the past we’ve used the data we collected to isolate several hard to track down sources of crashes and performance regressions vs code may use the hashed mac address to identify a machine over time for example we may use the hashed mac address to identify a particular machine experiencing an unusually high number of crashes which would skew our crash result information you are right that we could correlate a machine across data streams but that’s not how we use it -- we use the unique system information to connect things like crash reports with feature use when we first launched vs code we didn’t allow people to opt out of this collection of data because it was a pre-release product and we were trying to understand if the product was actually useful and had the right mix of features as a fully released and supported product from microsoft we now let users opt out of providing data -- if users don’t want to provide us with data then they can opt out but we really appreciate it when we do receive the telemetry as it helps improve the product for all that’s said we want to ensure users have adequate control i’d be happy to chat with you on this issue and the points you raise i think the easiest way to do that is to connect on emailskypehangout … i’m smcbreen@microsoftcom sean,M07,MISTAKE

he0189,i agree that disable_exception_catching doesn't really need 2 and can infer it from exception_catching_allowed but i'm not sure if we can remove it without breaking up existing makefiles and such we can break backward compatibility if it's really necessary but i'm not sure if this is an important enough reason to do it having said that i also agree this pr may not have enough traction the first version of the pr also contained lines like set_settings'inlining_limit' this means 1 inlining_limit can take any numeric value so only omitting 1 looked weird but i later realized those lines were caused by my mistakes 4 years ago and they really meant set_settings'inlining_limit' 50 see #13726 comment and #13726 comment and removed them from this pr which only leaves disable_exception_catching anyway closing this then,M01,MISTAKE
he0190,@eliasdaler i have two things in mind 1- i strongly want to discourage buildingpackaging imgui without making custom modifications made to imconfigh 2- i would prefer not signaling presence of build cruft in the root folder to strongly signify that it is optional as such as konstantin pointed out it's perfectly ok if the cmakefile provide that functionality as long as it has a solution to handle 1 and this is well documented message an error if imgui is build as a top-level project i'm not sure i understand this fully but it seems wrong we don't want to strongly enforce hard constraints i have strong design view on 1 and somehow 2 and that's one thing but flexibility is more important i have to apologies again if it seems that this pr feels neglected i do have a large amount of stuff on my plate and current priority is to advance viewportdocking i'm happy the pr is here and stable if anything i would much rather focus on getting satisfying vs-like sln output from the cmakefile than anything else,M07,MISTAKE

he0195,the flow should be something like this text is imprecise and this is a very low-fi rough wireframe design-wise some of this such as the reboot button being a split dropdown like the system overview could be deferred to another pr but this pr should have much of the general flow in the wireframe important parts let people know what's up as soon as possible they should expect that their system may need to be rebooted and that services might need to be restarted we should have a quick and dirty check that gets this mostly correct but might be wrong hence may having it all the time whenever updates are available would be bad however as people will just ignore it so it should be based on some sort of heuristics show the updates as they happen we have this already even in master provide feedback when the system is doing something such as checking to see if services need restarting andor the system needs rebooting we currently do not do this in the pr it's absolutely mandatory to have this step have three states at the end updated and doesn't need intervention in-page design like in cockpit currently services need restarting a dialog with a simple list of services that need to be restarted with all checked by default system needs a reboot — with a button to reboot the machine in-page design like in cockpit currently ideally with a split button like overview but that can be a future pr minimally the action needs to exist so a simple button should be enough we could do the reboot ignore pattern but switch ignore to manage services which would then show the services need restarting dialog but we'd need to keep the system needs rebooting state with an action button perhaps in a banner or alert in the software page and in the overview or we could make it a top-level shell thing in another pr i've bolded things which do not currently exist in the pr at least from what i saw earlier today hopefully this helps provide a direction thanks for doing the groundwork of integration i apologize for not putting this all together in a form like this already i've been busy with other stuff,M07,MISTAKE

he0197,ok i have some good news i was able solve the deployment problem mentioned on my previous comment i forgot to change the volume mount point when i moved the docker-composeyml to docker directory from root directory and docker was unable to find the files necessary silly mistake ruined my weekend but unfortunately haven't made any progress with rake testdb error yet there's a few commandline things which are pretty important to having a useful development environment such as running the test suite running rake commands eg for database migrations running the console connecting to the database with psql i'd like to make sure all of these things are possible in the dockerized development setup since at the moment i only see mention of running the webserver with vagrant for example you can just vagrant ssh into the virtual machine and do all of these things @gravitystorm they all are possible but for some reason i have setback regarding the rake testdb command might have something to do with the unix socket vs docker tpc connection as you have mentioned in your comment and yes you can also use bash on all of them if they are possible already great then it would be worthwhile documenting how that works since it's not obvious to me at least i just went through the old pr #1290 and found that @paulsturgess made a nice doc for docker usage will try to re-usere-purpose that and push it asap cheers,M09,MISTAKE

he0200,sorry perhaps i was not clear the readme is reflective of only of the state of the master branch but there has not been a release of the code since june today when you look at the readme it says the ktx library is no longer needed but then you actually add the latest version of the library to your project 031 you will find that you do still need the ktx library to get the extensions which causes a little bit of confusion edit it looks like the new website clarifies this,M05,MISTAKE

he0205,opting for the colorscheme for the code sidebar to be pretty much chosen at random there’s a feature that we’ve been working on-- it’s in its own branch and i’ve been the only one working on it,M06,MISTAKE
he0206,when starting back up the matrix it took me about a week to get familiar with the code again an issue of not documenting my own code well i didn’t really comment that stuff-- it’s a big file anyways so it can get confusing i think the lack of commenting that i did and documentation probably would have had a big impact… if it takes me about a week to figure out what my code is doing how long would it take someone else,M10,MISTAKE
he0207,i'd say my work the last two weeks on the matrix itself has been lacking due to underestimating how much less time i could devote to vhp at the end of the semester end of semester stuff… oh i can definitely devote 5 6 hours to vhp-- and then stuff pops up final projects,M07,MISTAKE
he0208,although there have been some big changes to vhp my matrix branch is still very much behind some of the newer code even though i planned to change that when i had more time i just haven't gotten around to it yet there was a big-- professor meneely kind of switched up how we did the front end-- cause we used to do everything in ruby webpack-- there was a gem for it but then that stopped getting supported so we changed up a bunch of stuff but this branch that i’m working on everything is still how it was probably last january or february 2-3 months ago just cause i haven’t put any-- much work into trying to-- cause i know when i do that-- it’s probably going to take a little time and i’m gonna have to work through some stuff so i keep i guess kicking the can down the road i’m not even touching any of that other stuff so i figure it would just be easier to… so i’ll finish this first part and then i’ll go back and make it all work,L04,LAPSE
he0209,on the current version of the sidebar hitting the arrow buttons should produce consistent but different behavior based on the file shown right now it's inconsistent and gives me errors something i didn’t really account for ,M01,MISTAKE
he0210,there's an offset value that needs to be accounted for when drawing stuff on the matrix so far i've fixed this with each component individually rather than making an effort each time something new is drawn to add padding for this offset right now it results in messed up sidebar code that goes too high i thought that i accounted for that when i did the whole initial-- make the lines of code and color them but then i noticed on some files the lines will extend almost above the darker area i knew it was an issue in the past so i think if i had just like set a hard value to it-- because i’m-- my idea on it now is when i find it it’s gonna be because whatever part that i’m drawing that line of code is not accounting for that amount of padding i need to give it so i think if i just went ahead before and said ‘alright i know this is probably gonna be an issue’-- if i just add a variable called code_padding with a value of like 50 or something and then add it to stuff i know is gonna get drawn in the code field then i can like solve it for the future when i try to mess around with it,L02,LAPSE
he0211,i haven't pushed my latest feature to github yet and it's been a few weeks,L06,LAPSE
he0212,on files with lines changed the edits do not register on the page the whole idea is if lines of code are edited that’s when it shows up on the sidebar but i noticed because i’ll print-- like to the console i’ll print like the actual lines that should be showing up on the sidebar but i noticed for some files that they have lines changed but nothing on the sidebar like nothing pops up that’s something that i failed to see or failed to do in my code-- just like look out for this issue because i know i’ve done this before maybe you have too where you think something’s going to be 100% right when you code it and then you go to run it and it goes wrong… that’s just not considering what would go wrong i guess,M15,MISTAKE
he0213,i've been assigning some code that executes to a variable even though that variable is never used and i could've rewritten that to just execute the command i think the unused variable thing is harmless,L03,LAPSE

he0216,used onchange= instead of onchange= in react cause in javascript you could do that and nothing would go wrong but since i was using react it went wrong,M03,MISTAKE
he0217,assumed push would return the array placed arraypushvariable in a dictionary i was trying to add… an object to this array and then put the array with the new object into the dictionary and i just placed arraypushvariable in the dictionary assuming that that line there would return the new array with the new object in it but it just returns the variable so it was an assumption error on my part i had to look up the push method and i looked at the documentation and i had definitely seen it returns the variable i just like-- i wasn’t thinking about it like i had probably glanced over it ,M03,MISTAKE
he0218,fixme comments were never re-visited once put down in code i put a few fixme just by some code that i was like-- i’ll get to this in the future and i just forgot about it i was like okay i’ll fix this because this isn’t the best way to do it how i’m doing what i said to do as a fixme is actually working right now and like looking back at it i didn’t think there was a need to change it at that time so that specific one that i was thinking of or two they were just artifacts like comments that didn’t need to be there,L03,LAPSE

he0222,forgot to remove artifact from original code example i was using to start the matrix just looking at code that other people made… i forget exactly what they did but there was some part of the example that i didn’t need to use at all… i don’t think i commented it out i think it was still getting rendered on the page… you couldn’t see it but the class was still there and everything,L03,LAPSE
he0223,adding a class from the css framework but having it give wrong functionality by making the element's width extend across the page so for the matrix i just need like little squares to be drawn… but then i was applying a css class from foundation that was giving the elements a whole lot more width you couldn’t see it visually but if you actually inspect the elements they would have like-- the width was set to 100% so it was like going across the whole page… i wanted the rest of the attributes of that class but that was something i didn’t catch that it was also doing that i didn’t want it to do in the description it says ‘produces and incorrect behavior’ i guess it’s not logic but all i was seeing was ‘incorrect behavior’ i applied this class to it and that’s not how i wanted it behaving,M06,MISTAKE
he0224,syntax for placing a variable in rest call changed across projects somehow the two projects were compiling code differently… that’s the only thing that was happening there’s no other possibility because i was trying the exact same thing but i had to do it in two different ways… it had to have been different versions in one project i had to write what the name of the variable was and the type and in the other one it was just the name of the variable,S03,SLIP
he0225,got stuck trying to do a specific style using inline styles in a map did not work i was trying to make a table and i was trying to like take an array use that map to like put the information into the array into a bunch of little graph objects and i was trying to make it alternate like make one have inline style of white and the other one be black or something like that i tried a lot of things and it was just pointless cause it’s not possible so i spent a lot of time on it i just took it by that last line ‘for example choosing to implement a database system in python rather than using sql’ and in my case it was just like choosing to create a systled graph object using like react rather than css… like i got it working with css at the end of the day this one had me stuck for a second yeah for a long a long time i don’t know why i was so hung up on that i thought that that was possible but it just wasn’t possible,M06,MISTAKE

he0228,forgot to reload page after updating database i don’t know if that’s the right-- it’s literally just a line of code like i forgot to reload the page after fetching the data so i was fetching it but it wasn’t displaying the data because i wasn’t reloading i didn’t really know what else to put that as i definitely knew that the page needed to be refreshed,L01,LAPSE

he0230,forgot to structure button layout with bootstrap grid it’s definitely a design feature because i was developing in like the mobile mode and i saw that there was something wrong there for a long time and i-- i knew it was a defect and it was in the requirements that that’s not allowed and yeah i did it like last minute,L01,LAPSE
he0231,didn't know having after function in js calls the function immediately,M03,MISTAKE
he0232,using a hard-coded value for a width property when one was already set the width property was-- that i was using for most other stuff on the page for the matrix was like a calculated value like based on the actual size of the page… so that calculated value was like 365 and that would have been better for the page and then a few places i just forgot about it totally and i said 350 and it was just like hardcoded in there i just need to remember what i actually make into a variable and then use it,S07,SLIP
he0233,forgetting about another piece of code from the example used for the timeline it wasn't affecting the timeline in any way but it was unnecessary there was like a block of code from whatever example i used to start that really wasn’t doing anything… like it didn’t need to be there at all,L03,LAPSE
he0234,error messages on scrollbar brush not realized until playing around with it testing something else there’s a feature on it where it’s like a timeline to show when developers did their commits and there’s like a little interactive scrollbar on the timeline and it changes the matrix based on it but i never really like--- once i got it working i think i just said ‘oh that’s great’ and i moved on and then i was looking at the console for something else yesterday and-- i guess just by chance i started messing around with the scrollbar it didn’t even have anything to do with it and then i started getting a bunch of errors back in the console whenever-- whenever i moved the scrollbar in a certain way so i’m guessing that that’s been there for a while… and i just haven’t tested out,S08,SLIP
he0235,in the master branch re-do by prof meneely a folder structure was changed but not mentioned affecting some files' locations in the merge we had a whole folder called frontend and that controlled like the-- pretty much all the frontend so the javascript the css for the site… professor meneely had been doing work to kind of change up how-- how the site would run like when you build it because we had some issues so he put in a lot of work to do that but all he told me was that he had just changed the way like one command was done so then when i went to merge… cause i had added a few files to-- like inside the frontend folder and it wasn’t just that there were some folders under the frontend folder that were renamed too so when i went to merge it was a bit-- like some things were-- were moved around in different places and because it didn’t really know where to put those files since it didn’t have like it’s original location yet and that’s something that i didn’t know that he did if it wasn’t caught then the user would have a whole to see a matrix visualization and nothing to show for it the second that he said master had been redone in a big way i should have probably merged and figured out all of the issues,M04,MISTAKE
he0236,html template wouldn’t load in django i was copying and pasting and it wouldn’t work copying from an html template like i found one on the internet and i was just trying to see if it would show up in django and it-- it wouldn’t load at all no matter what i did i was just kind of going in blindly just trying to see if that html file would present itself but it didn’t i bet if i read up on it it would have worked i never actually figured it out i probably spent 25-30 minutes on it though not too much,S03,SLIP
he0237,misclicked ‘undo changes’ in vscode lost progress on one file,S05,SLIP
he0238,forgot to tag code for review i was doing a lot of things at the same time and i-- i pushed my code out i cleaned my code i did-- i did like the whole run through the only thing i didn’t do was tag it so it was definitely just you know the last thing on the checklist didn’t get checked off,S04,SLIP
he0239,updating variable twice with different methods i was trying to get something done in one way… i erased most of it except for like one line where one of the variables was being replaced and i did it a different way-- i did it with a method to like set that variable instead of like accessing the variable… and yeah it just didn’t work right,L03,LAPSE
he0240,was pulling wrong attribute from aws resource using ref instead of getatt opening the documentation before i just jump into writing stuff i was writing things based on what the other code looked it and it worked like 80% of the time,M03,MISTAKE

he0243,for senior project last week my team went ahead and planned out stateprocess diagrams before meeting with the sponsor after meeting them we realized that the requirements given in the description did not match requirements given from the sponsor directly senior project page was pretty much half the requirements… so on our first meeting with the sponsor we kind like clarified what was on the page and the sponsor was like we kinda want more than that probably clarify requirements… before we jump into diagrams,M02,MISTAKE
he0244,deployed a website but the css wasn't linked correctly so it was just bare html when displayed teammate looked over it… you just have to add the dot-slash over it and now it works,S02,SLIP

he0246,senior project had a miscommunication in regards to some requirements had to re-evaluate the week after previous issue… is that we started off with requirements that we got off the webpage but then our sponsor was like ‘oh this is only half of what we want` so the week after since we had all those additional requirements we gathered them put them in a diagram and there was still some parts off that the sponsor disagreed on,M05,MISTAKE

he0266,i don't know what i did but i completely broke debugging on my project it skipping over functions i was trying to step into and going to lines that weren't even code just white space and comments pretty sure ide was misconfigured and over optimizing code it might have been something misconfigured in my project but everything i was doing to make it better only made it worse because i had no idea what i was doing,M12,MISTAKE

he0272,i used an == instead of a <= because i forgot how conditionals in for-loops worked this is what actually caused my the compiler to skip over this function when debugging so it's a continuation of the error i reported last time where i used an = instead of an ==,M01,MISTAKE
he0273,i masked my bits wrong so i didn't actually check the bit i thought it did,M01,MISTAKE

he0275,we've been using the wrong name for our senior project it's multispectral imaging system for historical artifacts not multi-spectral imaging system for humanities and archives none of us know where we got the other acronym from whether our sponsors told us the wrong thing at first or we googled it and someone else had it written like that we were using it for a minute before our sponsors caught it,M05,MISTAKE
he0276,after we reviewed our project plan with our sponsors we forgot to format our notes correctly into the plan so when our sponsors re-reviewed it they made comments on our formatting it wasn't really a feature or defect we had to fix it was just updating documentation and making it look nice just forgot to finish the work,L03,LAPSE
he0277,"some of my code would get deleted by the hardware-configuration generator thing we're using because it wasn't in the specified ""user code goes here"" i did it like three times before i figured out why that was happening comments in code used by generator i didn’t know that the generator kept deleting code in special comment block",M12,MISTAKE

he0285,my team member forgot to give me write access to the repository and forgot to give one our team members access at all i think the team member who had no access has something messed up with here email so it might be her fault or a mixture of both of them,M13,MISTAKE
he0286,had my code directory structured wrong so i couldn't import modules it's not really a configuration thing more of me forgetting that python has a specific structure for importing modules from the same project and not designing my code around that then flailing around trying to fix it,M09,MISTAKE
he0287,i couldn't find where the import error was because it was at the top of a file i though i was already at the top the error was happening because i imported something wrong i forgot if i spelled it wrong or if it didn't exist so i think that's a syntaxspelling error but it could also maybe be a wrong assumption error since i assumed i was at the top of the page,S05,SLIP
he0288,i forgot i needed to download device drivers before connecting to hardware i should have known that i needed drivers before connecting to hardware,L08,LAPSE

he0329,flipped what buttons were meant to increase the flash rate and decrease the flash rate my code and documentation were wrong part of it was also me naming my variables poorly like if the flash rate increases then the time between them decreases so i had increase decrease all over the place and i think i got confused what was increasing and decreasing,S03,SLIP
